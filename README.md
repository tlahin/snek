# Snake game project (AAA game btw, almost...)

Idea is simple.
Reproduce the good old snake game with some modifications.
Purpose of the project personally is to learn more python, pygame library and the syntax in general aswell as to see if I can actually code something on my own besides school work ðŸ˜„. A fellow contributor [Poks](github.com/pokspoks) helps me here and there with some of the problems I face during the journey.

# Requirements

	python (3.10)
	pygame (version?)

# Usage
	
	Use the start script "start.sh" to launch the app

# Working on:

	- Power ups
	- Difficulty (Gameplay, Options menu)

# Todo:

	- Make sure game objects don't overlap with eachother
	- In options menu, add emojis/cooler text for difficulty dropdown
	- Powerups such as speed/slow or immunity
	- Graphical effect for the snek
	- AI to play the game itself?
	- 'Tron' mode against AI snek?

# Controls:

	Move:
		'wasd' or arrow keys

	Pause/unpause:
		'space'

	debug:
		'g' to grow
		'h' to respawn food
		'j' to respawn wall
