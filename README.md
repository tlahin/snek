# Snake game project (AAA game btw, almost...)

Idea is simple. 
Reproduce the good old snake game with some modifications.
Purpose of the project personally is to learn more python, pygame library and the syntax in general aswell as to see if I can actually code something on my own besides school work ðŸ˜„. A fellow contributor [Poks](github.com/pokspoks) helps me here and there with some of the problems I face during the journey.

# Requirements

	python (3.10)
	pygame (version?)

# Usage
To launch the game, go to the root of the directory and type
	`python main.py`

# Working on:

	- Improving the wall generating algo
	- Difficulty (Gameplay, Options menu)

# Todo:

	- Different difficulties(?)
	- Powerups such as speed or immunity
	- AI to play the game itself
	- 'Tron' mode against AI snek

# Controls:

	Move:
		'wasd' or arrow keys
		
	Pause/unpause:
		'space'

	debug:
		'g' to grow
		'h' to respawn food
		'j' to respawn wall
